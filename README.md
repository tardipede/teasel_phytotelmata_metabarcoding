# Teasel phytotelmata metabarcoding

Data processing and analysis for the manuscript **"First insight into teasel phytotelmata biotic communities through DNA metabarcoding"**  
  
Teasels (biennial plants in the genus *Dipsacus*, see photos below) are widely distributed in Europe and produce tall stems in their second years of life which (in some species) bear multiple phytotelmata (see photo below) in the form of cup-shaped leaf axils. Those leaf-axils can retain water, however due to the short lived nature of the plant stems, those water reservoirs last only for a few months in spring-summer [@obovna2024water].  
This study aims at producing the first DNA metabarcoding dataset of *Dipsacus fullonum* phytotelmata and to answer three keys question that emerged from previous research [@obovna2024water] [@vergne2023pharaoh] regarding communities of teasel phytotelmata.
